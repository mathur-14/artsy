# Art Recommendation Microservice Project

## Project Overview

This project implements an **art recommendation system** that helps users discover artwork tailored to their preferences. The system uses data fetched from the **Artsy API**, which contains a large collection of artworks, including detailed information such as artists, genres, sales, and more. The primary aim is to make art discovery both efficient and enjoyable for users, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and fostering confidence in art investments.

## Key Features
